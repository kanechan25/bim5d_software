- The third stage, we will deal with rebar files. This form helps you calculate accurately the length of rebars, such as rebar hook, rebar bending, or rebar lap splices...
	Then results will are save and sync to Cloud.

- Finally, the most important, we calculate, take-off quantity, sum up and fill them to file BOQ (Bill of Quantity).
Rebars (structure department) also are added together on all final quantity BOQ.
	Quantities that are classified by categories or leveled by height make Quantity Surveyor easier about quantity management:
